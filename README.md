# GenCartoPro
GenCartoPro (GENeration of CARTOgraphic PROjections) is a MATLAB toolbox appropriate for the production of cartographic projections based on the generation of a rectangle grid with predefined cell size. Additionally, GenCartoPro supports the performance of cartographic projections using datasets referred to coastline spatial data. A demo file with world coastline dataset is provided for the execution of the corresponded m-file (source of world coastline data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/, the provided dataset has been modified in order to be adapted in GenCartoPro). The source code of GenCartoPro is distributed under the 3rd version of GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation (GPLv3).

GenCartoPro has been produced for the needs of Kallipos Project and specifically for the ebook of Analytical Cartography (Nakos, 2015).
